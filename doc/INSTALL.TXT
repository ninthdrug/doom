What you need:

 - java jdk version 1.6

 - scala version 1.9.1
 - ninthdrug

Optional:
 - postgresql
 - sudo rights to postgres user

Buildingct the tar ball.
 - Extract the tar ball.
 - Change to the doom2/trunk directory.
 - Edit the build.xml file to fit your installation. At the minimum you may
   want to change the scala.home property to point to your scala installtion
   and install.dir to point to where you want to install doom.  It is easiest
   to use the same directory that you installed ninthdrug.
 - Invoke ant.
 - Invoke ant install.

Configuring:
   The installation adds the path to the main doom configuration to your $HOME/.ninthdrug file.  That should be ${install.dir}/conf/doom.conf.  Edit this as 
you see fit.

   The doom database can be created by running the createdb.sh script.  
You will need sudo rights to the postgres user for this step.  
You will also be prompted for passwords to the doom and doomreader database users to be created.
Edit the doom.conf file to set the correct user and password for the doom database.
